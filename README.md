# DV-Hacks---Covid-19-ScannerThis is a Diagnostic Deep Learning Tool that Uses Chest X-rays to test for Covid-19. Our project gives a pre-diagnostic scan for patients who are in consideration of testing or may be experiencing symptoms.Our solution to the limited types of Covid 19 tests is a deep learning algorithm that uses convolutional neural networks to process chest x-ray images of patients. The website and mobile app solutions are instantaneous, automated, and not subject to human error, which is an issue with conventional covid tests because people have to do them manually, leading to high misdiagnostic potential. Our model reached an accuracy of 94% after its training in a VGG-19 model.
